The Standard Library is a special set of filters, approved or written by the Regolith maintainers. Standard Filters offers the safest, easiest, and best support. 

Please be aware that when running in safe mode, standard filters are the only filters allowed.

## Using a Standard Filter

The syntax for standard filters is like this:

```json
{
  "filter": "<filter_name>",
  "settings" { ... } // Optional
}
```
