# Regolith Docs

This folder contains all the docs for Regolith. It is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/)

## Running Locally
You can locally test the website by [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/) and then running `cd docs` and `npm run docs:dev`.

Assuming the dependencies were installed correctly, the local server will run and you should see `http://localhost:5173/`
printed out.

You can now make changes to any of the markdown files and you'll see the changes reflected at that URL in your browser!

## Contribution Guidelines

Please always put `docs:` at the start of your commit message.
