# Regolith Docs

This folder contains all the docs for Regolith. It is built using Jekyll, the the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

## Running Locally
You can locally test the website by [installing Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides) and then running  `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Assuming the Ruby dependencies installed correctly, the local server will run and you should see `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
printed out.

You can now make changes to any of the markdown files and you'll see the changes reflected at that URL in your browser! Note the site can take several seconds to rebuild, so have an eye on your terminal window

## Contribution Guidelines

Please always put `docs:` at the start of your commit message.
