# Standard Library

The Standard Library is a special set of filters, written by the Regolith maintainers. Standard Filters offers the safest, easiest, and best support.

## Standard Filters

| Filter | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [blockbench_convert](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/blockbench_convert) | Converts blockbench models into `.geometry.json` files. |
| [bump_manifest](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/bump_manifest) | Bumps the manifest version in your RP and BP. Good for multiplayer testing where you need to avoid pack-caching issues. |
| [filter_tester](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/filter_tester) | Meant to be used by the filter developers to test other filters. It compares the expected results with the files generated by Regolith. |
| [fix_emissive](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/fix_emissive) | Fixes emissive issues in your textures, by removing the color data from fully transparent pixels. |
| [gametests](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/gametests) | Compiles gametests into pack. |
| [json_cleaner](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/json_cleaner) | Removes comments from all json files in the project. Useful, since some filters cannot understand files with comments. |
| [name_ninja](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/name_ninja) | Automatically generates entity, block, spawn egg, and item names, based on a custom 'name' field, or on the entities identifier. |
| [texture_convert](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/texture_convert) | Converts popular image editor file formats, such as .psd to .png. |
| [texture_list](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith-filters/tree/master/texture_list) | Automatically creates the `texture_list.json` file, based on the images you've added into your resource pack. |

The full, up to date list of filters can be found on our github. We are looking into maintaining a list here, but for now please visit our GitHub.

## Using a Standard Filter

You may install standard filters by name. For example: `regolith install name_ninja`.

The syntax for standard filters usage is like this:

```json
{
  "filter": "<filter_name>",
  "settings" { ... } // Optional
}
```
