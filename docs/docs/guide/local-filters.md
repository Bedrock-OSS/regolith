# Local Filters

Local filters are great for quickly prototyping, or for personal filters that you do not want to share with anyone. In this case, you can simply run a local file:

```json
{
    "runWith": "python",
    "script": "./filters/example.py"
}
```

The `.` path will be local to the root of the regolith project.
