# Profiles

A `profile` is a collection of filters, settings, and export information. By default, a Regolith project will be initialized with a single profile, called `default`. You can add additional profiles, as you need them.

## Running Profiles

You can use `regolith run` to run the default profile (default), or use `regolith run <profile name>` to run a specific profile

## Why Profiles?

Profiles are useful for creating different run-targets. 

For example, `default` profile may contain development focused filters, which are not desired for a final build. You can create a `build` or `package` profile, potentially with a different export target to fill this need. 

You can now run `regolith run default` normally, and then sometimes `regolith run build` when you need a new final build.

Here is an example `config.json` with a second profile called `package`.

```json
{
  "name": "moondust",
  "author": "Regolith Gang",
  "packs": {
    "behaviorPack": "./packs/BP",
    "resourcePack": "./packs/RP"
  },
  "regolith": {

    // This is the list of profiles!
    "profiles": {

      // This is the default profile
      "default": {
        "filters": [
          {"filter": "example_filter"}
        ],
        "export": {
          "target": "development",
        }
      },

      // A second profile, with different filters
      "build": {
        "filters": [
          {"filter": "different_filter"}
        ],
        "export": {
          "target": "development",
        }
      }
    },
    "filterDefinitions": {},
    "dataPath": "./packs/data"
  }
}
```

## Profile Customization

For the most part, any setting inside of the Regolith config can be overridden inside of a particular profile. 

For example, `dataPath` can be defined at the top level, but customized per-profile if desired, by placing the key again inside of the profile: This path will be used when running this filter.
