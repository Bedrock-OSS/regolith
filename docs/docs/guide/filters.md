# Filters Introduction

A filter is any program or script that takes the files inside of your RP and BP and *transforms* them in some way. Many of these filters have already been written, and are included as part of the [standard library](/standard-library). You may also be interested in [community filters](/community-filters)

At it's core, you can think of a filter as the ability to run arbitrary code during the compilation process. This allows you to accomplish a number of tasks:

 - Linting and error checking
 - Code generation/automation
 - Interpreting custom syntax
