# Installing

::: info
Regolith can be installed, or downloaded as a standalone application. Both links can be found by going to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith/releases).

## Install (recommended)

First, download the `regolith-x.x.x.msi` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith/releases/latest) page.

## Stand-Alone (not recommended)

Regolith can also be installed stand-alone. Simply install the correct zip for your operating system. For windows, this is most likely `regolith_x.x.x_Windows_x86_64.zip`.

You may unzip this package, and place the `Regolith.exe` file somewhere convenient. In stand-alone mode, you will need a copy of the regolith executable in every project that you intend to use Regolith with.

After download, you can run by typing `Regolith.exe`, as long as you are in the same folder as the executable. If you want to run from anywhere, consider installing.
