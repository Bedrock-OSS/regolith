# NodeJS Filters

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

## Installing NodeJS

Before you can run Node filters, you will need to [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Running NodeJS code as Filter

The syntax for running a nodejs filter is this:

```json
{
  "runWith": "nodejs",
  "script": "./filters/example.js",

  // Optional property that defines the path to the folder with the package.json file
  "requirements": "./filters"
}
```

## Requirements and Dependencies

When installing, regolith will check for a `package.json` file. If requirements property is specified
reqolith will look in that folder, otherwise it will look in the folder with the script.

When developing a Node filter with dependencies, you must create this file. You can create a `package.json` file yourself by using `npm init`.
